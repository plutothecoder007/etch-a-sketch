Project: Etch-A-Sketch

1. Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
    - Make a function that creates divs. (CHECK)
    - The function takes 1 parameter. (CHECK)
    - The function will be activated by pressing the button. (CHECK)
2. Put divs into a "container" div. (CHECK)
3. Use flexbox to make divs appear as a grid.(CHECK)
4. Set up a "hover" effect so that grid divs change colour when mouse passes over them, leaving a pixelated trail through the grid like a pen would. (CHECK)
5. Add a button on the top of the screen that will alert the user asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before. (max 100)
